# Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

A major contribution to India's economy is made by Agriculture. A lot of families in India directly or indirectly depend on farming
in general. Hence, we can say farming is an integral part of India and define who we are as a country. A larger part of the Indian
farming population trusts in relying upon their instinct to conclude which yield to plant in a specific season. They usually take
historical parameters and ancestral farming patterns into consideration without knowing that crop depends on weather, present-day,
and soil conditions. Thus, it is difficult in a sense to blame a farmer for all of their decisions because of innumerable factors that
are involved. A wrong or misguided decision by a farmer can have a lot of impact on the agricultural economy of that region and
India in a broader sense. A combination of machine learning algorithms, historical and scientifically collected soil parameters, and
weather data can help predict the most appropriate crop to be sown on the farm.
